# Pull Request Description

This submission introduces a comprehensive Tweet application that facilitates the management and generation of tweets from movie reviews. Built using TypeScript for type safety and maintainability, the architecture is designed to be modular and extensible. The application consists of several key components, including service classes, utility functions, and data models.

## Key Components

### Services

- **TweetService**: Central to the application, this service handles the logic for generating tweets based on movie reviews. It adheres to defined formatting rules, ensuring that each tweet fits within character limits while conveying essential information.
  
- **MovieService**: Manages the retrieval and storage of movie data, utilizing a mapping structure for efficient lookups by title.
  
- **ReviewService**: Responsible for reading and managing reviews, it logs warnings when the review data is empty, ensuring transparency in data handling.

### Utility Classes

- **FileReader**: A utility for reading JSON files, which includes robust error handling to manage various file read scenarios, such as empty files or invalid JSON formats.
  
- **StringFormatter**: Provides string manipulation methods that assist in formatting tweets and other textual outputs, promoting consistency across the application.

## Design Choices

The application follows a layered architecture, separating concerns among services, utilities, and models. This design enhances code readability and testability, allowing individual components to be easily maintained and updated. Extensive error handling and logging are implemented throughout the services to ensure that any issues are promptly reported and do not disrupt the user experience.

Additionally, the application is equipped with unit tests using Jest, covering critical functionalities and edge cases, thereby ensuring reliability and robustness. Overall, the architecture not only supports current functionalities but is also adaptable for future enhancements, such as adding new features or integrating additional data sources.
